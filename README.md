# Number Guessing Game

This is one of my first projects where I created a simple game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.

## About the Project

I followed a tutorial from YouTube videos to build the game and debugged it as I went. Whenever I encountered issues or errors, I asked ChatGPT for help, which was very useful.

### Features
- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The player attempts to guess the number.
- The game provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## How It Works

1. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The player guesses a number.
3. The game compares the guess with the random number and gives feedback.
4. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

## Technologies Used
- Python (for the game logic)
